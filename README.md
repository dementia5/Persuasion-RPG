🎩 Victorian Gothic Atmosphere

Set in the eerie halls of a decaying Victorian estate, Persuasion draws you into a labyrinth of candlelit corridors, locked attics, and crumbling cellars—each filled with cryptic objects, ritualistic clues, and unspeakable horrors. Lovecraftian madness blends with British restraint in this masterclass of moody mystery.

💀 Murder. Mystery. Madness.

Unravel a chilling murder plot by:

- 🔍 Investigating over two dozen uniquely described rooms, from the Parlor to the Torture Chamber.
- 🧠 Interrogating up to 8 suspects, each with their own alibis, motives, and behavioral traits.
- 📓 Tracking clues and suspicions through your interactive investigation journal.
- 🎭 Evaluating suspect credibility using a dynamic truth-detection system based on your perception, sanity, and growing reputation.
- 🩸 Engaging in deadly confrontations if the murderer strikes—or if you do.

For a full overview of the mystery, see the [Main Mystery Guide](MainMystery.md).

🕹️ Retro Mechanics, Modern Depth

With its nostalgic ASCII-style map, fully text-driven interface, and Choose-Your-Own-Adventure pacing, Persuasion pays tribute to the golden era of narrative games. But beneath the classic surface lies a modern engine featuring:

- 🗺️ Procedurally generated mansions—each run is different.
- 👁️ Fog-of-war navigation, blocked passages, and hidden paths.
- 📦 Inventory, stat-based character creation, and clue discovery.
- 🧍‍♂️ Dynamic NPC movement: suspects roam the mansion as you do, raising tension and uncertainty.
- 💬 Hybrid interrogation-combat system—ask the wrong questions, and you might bleed for it.
- ⏳ Turn-based progression ensures that your choices shape the story… and the map.

🧠 Replayable, Deep, and Immersive

No two playthroughs are alike. With over 120 potential room nodes, branching paths, stat-based combat, and randomized clue & suspect combinations, Persuasion invites repeat investigations. A full session can last 2–5 hours, or stretch longer for completionists and careful sleuths.

👁️‍🗨️ Low Magic. High Dread.

The world of Persuasion features subtle supernatural elements, rooted in psychological horror and spiritual dread. Sanity is your most fragile asset. As your mind fractures, room descriptions distort, text clarity declines, and even the map can lie.
